                    Bicycle riding is a fun activity that most children are taught early. It helps keep them active and energized, and it is also an excellent way to reinforce their social skills and emotional wellness. While some people may abandon their bikes after childhood and adolescence – when the pressures of adulthood start looming over them – many others realize the positive impact cycling has on their overall well-being.

                            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
