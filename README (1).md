# Parallax Website

Welcome to my parallax project! This exciting web project was crafted using HTML and CSS, and it aims to provide users with a dynamic and interactive browsing experience.

The website is designed with multiple sections, each featuring its own parallax effect. As users scroll down, they are immersed in a dynamic 3D-like experience, where background and foreground elements move at different speeds, creating an illusion of depth and adding a sense of interactivity.

I'm proud of the effort and creativity I've put into this parallax website project, and I hope you enjoy exploring the immersive and visually captivating experience that I've crafted using HTML and CSS.
